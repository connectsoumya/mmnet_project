How to run:-

Since the dependencies do not get uploaded in github, to make the package self-contained as much as possible, we upload as a zip file. Extract everything inside the zip file.

Upload everything to the server to run. There are few changes which needs to be done.

The main files for the web page, 'index.php' and 'senddata.php' can be found under the directory 'web'.

Packages used - Facebook SDK for PHP, Flintstone, ext-mbstring. They are already added to composer.json file.

1) In line 25 of 'index.php', the page access token corresponds to our page created for experiments. To fetch data from your page, replace it with your own page access token which can be obtained from facebook.
2) In line 37 of 'index.php' and line 15 of 'senddata.php', the following changes are required to use it for your own facebook application
		FacebookSession::setDefaultApplication('YOUR APP ID', 'YOUR APP SECRET');
   Your app id and app secret can be obtained from facebook from your app dashboard.
